# KLIQ Coach Growth Services

## From Activation to Revenue: PPC, Affiliates, Licensing & Brand Deals

**Prepared by:** KLIQ Growth Team
**Date:** February 2026
**Data Sources:** BigQuery (rcwl-data) — Stripe, Apple App Store, Google Play Store

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

KLIQ hosts 1,367+ coach apps. Of these, **124 coaches have generated revenue totalling $917,930** across three channels: Stripe subscriptions ($850K), Apple IAP ($44K), and Google Play ($24K). Revenue is extremely top-heavy — the top 7 coaches ($50K+) generate $577K, or 63% of all GMV.

The opportunity: **1,243 coaches have zero revenue.** Even among revenue-generating coaches, most plateau after exhausting their organic audience. KLIQ can unlock the next phase of growth by offering managed growth services — PPC advertising, affiliate partnerships, content licensing, and brand deals — earning new revenue streams while helping coaches scale.

**Projected new revenue from growth services:**
- **Year 1:** £66K
- **Year 2:** £296K

This is on top of existing hosting fees and application fees ($81K total to date).

## PART 1: THE DATA — Where Coaches Are Today

### 1.1 — Platform Revenue Overview

| Channel | Total GMV | % of Total |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Stripe (web subscriptions)** | $850,231 | 92.6% |
| **iOS App Store (IAP)** | $43,541 | 4.7% |
| **Google Play Store (IAP)** | $24,159 | 2.6% |
| **Total** | **$917,930** | **100%** |

> **Key insight:** Stripe dominates. Most coaches earn through web subscriptions, not in-app purchases. However, IAP is growing — coaches with both channels earn 20–40% more than Stripe-only coaches.

### 1.2 — GMV Distribution by Revenue Tier

| Revenue Tier | Coaches | Total GMV | Avg GMV | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| $1–99 | 32 | $1,107 | $35 | Just getting started |
| $100–499 | 31 | $9,160 | $295 | Early traction |
| $500–999 | 11 | $8,221 | $747 | Building momentum |
| $1K–5K | 27 | $66,212 | $2,452 | Proven product-market fit |
| $5K–10K | 5 | $32,176 | $6,435 | Ready for paid growth |
| $10K–50K | 11 | $224,284 | $20,389 | Established coaches |
| $50K+ | 7 | $576,770 | $82,396 | Platform stars |
| **Total** | **124** | **$917,930** | **$7,403** | |

> The top 7 coaches generate $577K — more than the other 117 combined. The $1K–5K tier (27 coaches) represents the biggest growth opportunity.

### 1.3 — Subscriber Milestones

| Milestone | Coaches Who Reached It | Significance |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| 10+ subscribers | 74 | Basic traction |
| 50+ subscribers | 47 | Ready for PPC |
| 100+ subscribers | 34 | Growing audience |
| **250+ subscribers** | **21** | **Brand-ready** |
| 500+ subscribers | 16 | Established |
| 1,000+ subscribers | 12 | Platform stars |
| 2,500+ subscribers | 7 | Top tier |

> **21 coaches have hit 250+ subscribers** — these are ready for affiliate/licensing/brand deals today. The goal is to grow this to 50+ within 12 months.

### 1.4 — Top Earning Coaches

| Coach | Total GMV | Stripe | IAP | MRR (30d) | Total Subs |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----|-----------|------------|
| Bodied By XO | $111,366 | $111,366 | $0 | $1,794 | 4,844 |
| Lift Your Vibe | $104,115 | $102,273 | $1,842 | $825 | 4,548 |
| Shaped By London | $86,730 | $66,725 | $20,005 | $986 | 9,215 |
| Raw Fitness App | $83,609 | $83,609 | $0 | $0 | 2,417 |
| Verdure by Lottie | $70,060 | $50,075 | $19,985 | $470 | 4,607 |
| Jenn Lab Fit | $63,326 | $63,326 | $0 | $754 | 1,847 |
| CHAMPIONFIT | $57,564 | $54,526 | $3,038 | $909 | 4,551 |
| Bettr | $43,644 | $42,822 | $822 | $177 | 3,622 |
| Flowi | $27,403 | $25,473 | $1,930 | $30 | 1,023 |
| CORE by Desi Johnson | $24,335 | $24,335 | $0 | $0 | 2,522 |
| Reese Evans | $22,464 | $22,464 | $0 | $1,315 | 1,785 |
| skinnygirlfit | $20,917 | $20,917 | $0 | $80 | 2,170 |

> **Revenue channel insight:** 5 of the top 12 coaches earn 100% through Stripe with zero IAP. Coaches like Shaped By London and Verdure earn significantly from both channels. Enabling IAP for Stripe-only coaches is a quick win.

### 1.5 — Growth Trends (Last 3 Months vs Previous 3)

**Fastest growing coaches:**

| Coach | Recent 3m Subs | Prev 3m Subs | Growth % | Recent 3m GMV |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Livinia | 18 | 4 | +350% | $132 |
| Jenn Lab Fit | 92 | 49 | +87.8% | $4,730 |
| Besties in Jesus | 75 | 44 | +70.5% | $2,145 |
| Health Without Risk | 21 | 13 | +61.5% | $384 |
| Bodied By XO | 318 | 214 | +48.6% | $6,329 |
| REBARRE STRONG | 61 | 45 | +35.6% | $1,424 |
| Bettr | 110 | 83 | +32.5% | $776 |
| Reese Evans | 518 | 425 | +21.9% | $6,199 |

**Declining coaches (need intervention):**

| Coach | Recent 3m Subs | Prev 3m Subs | Growth % |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Shaped By London | 417 | 481 | -13.3% |
| Ladies who Crunch | 120 | 130 | -7.7% |
| Shaped By Kayla G | 9 | 13 | -30.8% |
| A.B.S. Wellness | 8 | 11 | -27.3% |

### 1.6 — IAP Unit Economics (Paying Users)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **LTV per paying user** | **$43.07** |
| **Avg renewals per buyer** | **4.2x** |
| **Total purchases (all-time)** | 4,505 |
| **Total recurring payments** | 19,119 |
| **Apps with IAP revenue** | 46 |
| **Platform IAP revenue** | $194,015 |

> A paying user generates $43 in lifetime value through an average of 4.2 renewal cycles. This is the foundation for the PPC ROI model.

### 1.7 — What Drives Revenue: Engagement Patterns

| Metric | PRIME Apps (>$5K) | GROWTH Apps ($1K–5K) | EMERGING (<$1K) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Livestreams/month | 2.3 | 6.2 | 0.4 |
| Live joins/month | 15.8 | 55.0 | 2.1 |
| Workouts completed/month | 241 | 55 | 8 |
| Community posts/month | 12.5 | 8.3 | 1.2 |
| Recurring payments/month | 67 | 18 | 3 |
| Modules published | 45+ | 15+ | 3 |
| Programs published | 5+ | 2+ | 0.5 |

> **Key finding:** Livestreaming is the strongest predictor of revenue. GROWTH apps actually livestream more frequently than PRIME apps — they're building community. PRIME apps have deeper content libraries (more modules/programs) which drive workout completions and renewals.

---

## PART 2: STRATEGIC CLUSTERS

Based on live data analysis, coaches fall into five strategic clusters:

| Cluster | Criteria | Apps | Combined Revenue | KLIQ Revenue | Strategy |

```

---

### STAGE 1: LAUNCH (0–50 Subscribers) — Included Free

**Current reality:** 1,243+ coach apps have zero revenue. Most never get their first subscriber.

**What KLIQ Provides (Free, Built Into Platform):**

| Service | What It Does | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **AI Blog Writer** | Turns social content into blogs | Blog engagement = +43pp retention |
| **5-Step Activation Checklist** | Guided first hour | 73% never take action — fix this |
| **Store in 5 Minutes** | Web storefront fast track | Instant live URL to share |
| **Social Share Templates** | Pre-written posts for IG/TikTok | Only 0.3% currently share their URL |
| **Pricing Benchmarks** | "Coaches in your niche charge £X–Y/month" | Removes pricing paralysis |

**KLIQ's revenue at this stage:** Hosting fee only (existing model).

**Success metric:** Coach gets to 50 paying subscribers.

---

### STAGE 2: GROW (50–250 Subscribers) — KLIQ Managed PPC

**The opportunity:** 47 coaches have 50+ subscribers but only 21 have hit 250. There's a clear gap where coaches plateau because they've exhausted their organic audience.

#### KLIQ Ads Manager (Managed PPC Service)

**The pitch to coaches:** *"You focus on content. We'll bring you subscribers."*

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **What KLIQ does** | Runs Meta (Instagram/Facebook) and TikTok ads on behalf of the coach |
| **Ad creative** | KLIQ's team creates ads using coach's existing content (videos, photos, testimonials) |
| **Targeting** | Fitness/wellness audiences, lookalikes of existing subscribers, geo-targeted |
| **Landing page** | Coach's KLIQ web storefront (already built) |
| **Budget** | Coach sets monthly ad spend (min £200/month recommended) |
| **KLIQ fee** | Hybrid: £49/month base + £5 per new subscriber acquired |
| **Reporting** | Monthly dashboard: impressions, clicks, signups, cost per subscriber |

#### Pricing Model Options

| Model | Coach Pays | KLIQ Earns | Best For |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **% of Ad Spend** | Ad budget + 20% mgmt fee | 20% of ad spend | Higher-budget coaches |
| **Flat Fee** | £99/month + ad budget | £99/month | Predictable for coaches |
| **Performance** | £5–15 per new subscriber acquired | Per-sub fee | Risk-sharing model |
| **Hybrid (Recommended)** | £49/month + £5 per new sub | Base + performance | Best alignment |

**Recommended model: Hybrid (£49/month + £5 per new subscriber)**
- Coach pays a low base fee (covers KLIQ's ad management costs)
- Plus a per-subscriber fee that aligns incentives
- At 250 subscribers: coach has paid ~£49/month x 6 months + £5 x 200 new subs = ~£1,294 total
- If coach charges £10/month per sub: 250 subs = £2,500/month MRR — KLIQ's fee is less than 1 month of revenue

#### PPC Unit Economics

Based on industry benchmarks for fitness/wellness app advertising:

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Cost per click (CPC)** | £0.80 | £0.50 | £0.30 |
| **Landing page conversion** | 5% | 8% | 12% |
| **Cost per signup** | £16.00 | £6.25 | £2.50 |
| **Signup to paid conversion** | 15% | 25% | 35% |
| **Cost per paying subscriber** | £106.67 | £25.00 | £7.14 |
| **Monthly ad spend for 50 new subs** | £5,333 | £1,250 | £357 |

**Validated by live data:** IAP LTV per paying user is **$43.07** with **4.2x average renewals**. At moderate CPA of £25, a subscriber pays for themselves in ~2.5 months at £10/month pricing. Coaches charging £25–35/month (Jenn Lab Fit, Ladies who Crunch, Besties in Jesus) have the best unit economics.

#### Break-Even CPA Analysis for KLIQ

At different KLIQ fee levels, here is the maximum CPA where KLIQ still profits:

| KLIQ Total Take | Break-even CPA | Coach Still Gets | Viable? |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 8% (current avg) | $3.46 | $26.78/buyer | Too tight |
| 10% | $4.32 | $25.91/buyer | Marginal |
| **15%** | **$6.48** | **$23.75/buyer** | **Achievable** |
| 20% | $8.64 | $21.59/buyer | Comfortable |
| 25% | $10.80 | $19.43/buyer | Strong margin |

> **Recommendation:** KLIQ needs a **15%+ total take** (existing fee + ad management fee) for managed PPC to be sustainable. At 15%, the break-even CPA is £6.48 — achievable for fitness apps on Meta/TikTok.

#### Social Media Growth Toolkit

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Content Calendar** | AI-generated posting schedule based on their niche |
| **Hashtag Research** | Optimised hashtags for their fitness vertical |
| **Cross-Promotion** | Feature coaches in KLIQ's own social channels |
| **Referral Program** | "Invite a friend, both get 1 month free" |
| **Email Templates** | Pre-written email sequences for coach's existing audience |
| **QR Code Generator** | For in-person events, gym walls, business cards |

#### The "250 Club" Milestone

When a coach hits 250 subscribers, they unlock Stage 3 services — affiliate marketplace, brand deal introductions, content licensing opportunities, and a premium coach badge on their store.

---

### STAGE 3: MONETISE (250+ Subscribers) — Affiliates, Licensing & Brand Deals

**Currently 21 coaches qualify. Goal: 50+ within 12 months.**

#### 3.1 — KLIQ Affiliate Marketplace

KLIQ curates a marketplace of affiliate products relevant to fitness/wellness coaches. Coaches add affiliate links to their blogs, modules, and live sessions. They earn commission on every sale.

**How it works:**

```
Brand (e.g., protein powder company)
    |
Lists products on KLIQ Affiliate Marketplace
    |
Coach selects relevant products for their audience
    |
KLIQ auto-inserts affiliate links into coach's:
  - Blog posts (contextual product mentions)
  - Module descriptions ("Equipment I recommend")
  - Community posts
  - Live session descriptions
    |
User clicks -> buys -> Coach earns commission
    |
KLIQ takes 10-20% of the affiliate commission as platform fee
```

**Affiliate categories for fitness/wellness:**

| Category | Example Brands | Typical Commission | Est. Revenue Per Coach/Month |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Supplements** | MyProtein, Huel, Bulk | 8–15% | £50–200 |
| **Equipment** | Amazon, Decathlon, Gymshark | 3–10% | £30–100 |
| **Apparel** | Gymshark, Lululemon, Nike | 5–12% | £20–80 |
| **Apps/Software** | MyFitnessPal, Strava, Whoop | £5–15 per signup | £50–150 |
| **Nutrition/Meal Prep** | HelloFresh, Gousto | £10–20 per signup | £40–100 |
| **Wellness** | Headspace, Calm, CBD brands | 10–25% | £30–80 |

**Estimated affiliate income for a coach with 250 subscribers:**
- 250 subscribers x 10% click-through rate = 25 clicks/month per product
- 25 clicks x 5% conversion = 1.25 sales/month per product
- Average order value £40 x 10% commission = £4 per sale
- 5 products featured = £25/month in affiliate income
- At scale (1,000 subs): £100–400/month

**KLIQ's revenue:** 10–20% platform fee on all affiliate commissions. If 50 coaches earn avg £100/month in affiliates = £5,000/month total, KLIQ takes £500–1,000/month.

#### 3.2 — Content Licensing

**A) Coach-to-Coach Licensing**

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concept** | Top coaches license their programs to newer coaches who need content |
| **Example** | "Shaped By London's 12-Week Shred" available for other coaches to offer in their app |
| **Pricing** | £50–200/month per license OR 20% revenue share |
| **KLIQ's cut** | 15% platform fee |

**B) Corporate Wellness Licensing**

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concept** | Companies license coach content for employee wellness programs |
| **Pricing** | £500–5,000/month per corporate client |
| **KLIQ's cut** | 25% platform fee (KLIQ handles the B2B sales) |
| **Market size** | Corporate wellness is a £4.5B market in the UK |

**C) Gym & Studio Licensing**

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concept** | Gyms license on-demand content from KLIQ coaches for their members |
| **Pricing** | £200–1,000/month per gym |
| **KLIQ's cut** | 20% platform fee |

#### 3.3 — Brand Deals (Managed by KLIQ)

KLIQ acts as a talent agency, connecting coaches with brands for sponsored content, product collaborations, and ambassador deals.

**Why 250 subscribers is the magic number:**
- Micro-influencers (1K–10K followers) command £100–500 per sponsored post
- But KLIQ coaches have something better: **a paying audience** — 250 people who already spend money on fitness
- A coach with 250 paying subscribers is more valuable to brands than an influencer with 50K followers and zero monetisation
- Brands pay for access to **buyers**, not just eyeballs

**Brand deal types:**

| Deal Type | What Coach Does | Coach Earns | KLIQ Earns |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Sponsored Blog Post** | Writes about brand's product | £200–500 per post | 15% agency fee |
| **Product Integration** | Features product in a module or live session | £300–1,000 per integration | 15% agency fee |
| **Ambassador Deal** | Ongoing partnership (3–12 months) | £500–2,000/month | 15% agency fee |
| **Co-Branded Product** | Coach's name on a product | 5–15% royalty on sales | 10% of royalty |
| **Exclusive Discount Code** | Coach shares brand's discount code | £1–5 per use + affiliate % | 10% platform fee |

**Estimated brand deal income for a coach with 250+ subscribers:**
- 1–2 sponsored posts/month: £400–1,000
- 1 product integration/quarter: £300–1,000
- Ambassador deal (if secured): £500–2,000/month
- **Total potential: £700–3,000/month** on top of subscription revenue

**KLIQ's Brand Deal Process:**
1. KLIQ identifies brands targeting fitness/wellness audiences
2. KLIQ pitches: "We have 21 coaches with 250+ paying subscribers"
3. Brand selects coaches based on niche, audience, engagement
4. KLIQ negotiates deal terms (coach approves)
5. Coach creates content / integrates product
6. KLIQ tracks performance, handles payments
7. KLIQ takes 15% agency fee

---

### STAGE 4: SCALE (1,000+ Subscribers) — Premium Services

**Currently 12 coaches qualify. These are the platform's stars.**

**4.1 — White-Label Content Marketplace**
- Top coaches sell their programs as white-label content
- Other fitness businesses buy and rebrand the content
- Coach earns royalties (5–15% of sales)
- KLIQ handles distribution, payments, DRM
- Example: "Shaped By London's 12-Week Program" sold to 50 gyms at £200/month = £10,000/month, coach gets £1,500/month royalty

**4.2 — Premium Brand Partnerships**
- Multi-month ambassador contracts (£2,000–10,000/month)
- Product co-creation (royalty deals)
- Event sponsorships
- TV/media appearances (KLIQ acts as agent)

**4.3 — Cross-Promotion Network**
- KLIQ creates a network where top coaches promote each other
- "If you like CHAMPIONFIT, you might also like REBARRE STRONG"
- Coaches share subscribers through curated recommendations
- KLIQ takes a referral fee for cross-promoted signups

**4.4 — KLIQ Creator Fund**
- KLIQ invests £1,000–5,000 in PPC for selected coaches
- In exchange, KLIQ takes a higher revenue share (e.g., 25% of GMV for 12 months)
- Accelerates growth for coaches who can't afford PPC upfront
- Risk: KLIQ invests upfront, but data shows coaches with 250+ subs have 94% survival rate

## PART 7: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**Why KLIQ can win at this:**

1. **Data moat** — KLIQ knows exactly which coaches are growing, what content works, and which audiences convert. No other platform has this depth of coach performance data.

2. **Built-in storefront** — Coaches already have a live URL. PPC traffic goes straight to a conversion-optimised page, not a generic social profile.

3. **Subscription audience > followers** — A coach with 250 paying subscribers is more valuable to brands than an influencer with 50K followers. KLIQ coaches have proven buyers.

4. **Vertical focus** — Fitness/wellness is the #1 earning category in the creator economy (avg $11,939/month on video platforms). KLIQ owns this niche.

5. **Full stack** — KLIQ can offer PPC, Affiliates, Brand Deals, and Licensing all in one platform. Coaches don't need to cobble together 5 different tools.

6. **Aligned incentives** — KLIQ earns more when coaches earn more. Every service is designed to grow the coach's revenue, which grows KLIQ's revenue.
