<p>Hey {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>It's Ben from KLIQ — I wanted to reach out because you showed interest in our Partner Program a while back, and I
    didn't want you to miss something new we've just launched.</p>

<p>We know the reality for most coaches: content creation is the easy part, but building a real business around it is
    hard. Juggling multiple tools, broken links, manual admin — it all eats into the time you should be spending
    coaching.</p>

<p>That's why we've launched <strong>KLIQ Concierge</strong> — your complete business-building package. Think of it as
    having your own operations team:</p>

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse; margin:16px 0;">
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:12px; border:1px solid #e0e0e0; background:#F9FFED;">
            <strong>Dedicated Virtual Assistant</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:13px;">15 hours per week of hands-on support from a VA trained on KLIQ systems,
                coaching models, and monetisation strategies.</span>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:12px; border:1px solid #e0e0e0;">
            <strong>Your All-in-One Platform</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:13px;">One platform for every channel — digital store, branded app, courses,
                subscriptions, 1:1 bookings. No integrations needed, everything under one roof.</span>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:12px; border:1px solid #e0e0e0; background:#F9FFED;">
            <strong>Multiple Revenue Streams</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:13px;">Turn a single piece of content into recurring income — subscriptions, courses,
                in-app purchases, and more. Build revenue that works while you sleep.</span>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>What your Concierge helps with:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Setting up your digital store and configuring products</li>
    <li>Content uploads, scheduling, and ongoing optimisation</li>
    <li>Client management and admin tasks</li>
    <li>Preparing and launching your custom branded app</li>
    <li>Growth initiatives — from launch sprints to scaling</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Book a demo → get matched with your dedicated VA → plan your launch → go live with
    confidence. Use your 15 hours flexibly, from launch sprints to ongoing maintenance.</p>

<p>All of this for just <strong>$500/month</strong> — and you can cancel any time.</p>
