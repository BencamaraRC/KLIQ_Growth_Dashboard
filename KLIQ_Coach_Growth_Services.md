|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|

| Crazy Discount Codes | 11,541 | 0 | 0% | $0 |
| Shaped By London | 10,391 | 9,215 | 88.7% | $66,625 |
| CHAMPIONFIT | 1,189 | 4,551 | — | $54,321 |

| Lift Your Vibe | 402 | 4,548 | — | $80,515 |
| Bettr | 776 | 3,622 | — | $33,678 |

**Note:** Some apps show more paying subs than total users because the events table counts unique event users, while invoices count all subscription payments including renewals.

## STAGE 1: LAUNCH (0-50 Subscribers) — Included Free

**Current reality:** 1,346 coach apps have zero revenue. Most never get their first subscriber.

### What KLIQ Provides (Free, Built Into Platform)

| Service | What It Does | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **AI Blog Writer** | Turns social content into blogs | Blog engagement = +43pp retention |
| **5-Step Activation Checklist** | Guided first hour | 73% never take action — fix this |
| **Store in 5 Minutes** | Web storefront fast track | Instant live URL to share |
| **Social Share Templates** | Pre-written posts for IG/TikTok | Only 0.3% currently share their URL |
| **Pricing Benchmarks** | "Coaches in your niche charge £X-Y/month" | Removes pricing paralysis |

**KLIQ's revenue at this stage:** Hosting fee only (existing model).

**Success metric:** Coach gets to 50 paying subscribers.

---

## STAGE 2: GROW (50-250 Subscribers) — KLIQ Managed PPC

**The opportunity:** 47 coaches have 50+ subscribers but only 21 have hit 250. There's a clear gap where coaches plateau because they've exhausted their organic audience.

### 2.1 — KLIQ Ads Manager (Managed PPC Service)

**The pitch to coaches:** "You focus on content. We'll bring you subscribers."

**How it works:**

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **What KLIQ does** | Runs Meta (Instagram/Facebook) and TikTok ads on behalf of the coach |
| **Ad creative** | KLIQ's team creates ads using coach's existing content (videos, photos, testimonials) |
| **Targeting** | Fitness/wellness audiences, lookalikes of existing subscribers, geo-targeted |
| **Landing page** | Coach's KLIQ web storefront (already built) |
| **Budget** | Coach sets monthly ad spend (min £200/month recommended) |
| **KLIQ fee** | 20% management fee on ad spend OR £99/month flat fee (whichever is higher) |
| **Reporting** | Monthly dashboard: impressions, clicks, signups, cost per subscriber |

**Pricing model options:**

| Model | Coach Pays | KLIQ Earns | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **% of Ad Spend** | Ad budget + 20% mgmt fee | 20% of ad spend | Higher-budget coaches |
| **Flat Fee** | £99/month + ad budget | £99/month | Predictable for coaches |
| **Performance** | £5-15 per new subscriber acquired | Per-sub fee | Risk-sharing model |
| **Hybrid** | £49/month + £5 per new sub | Base + performance | Best alignment |

**Recommended model: Hybrid (£49/month + £5 per new subscriber)**
- Coach pays a low base fee (covers KLIQ's ad management costs)
- Plus a per-subscriber fee that aligns incentives
- At 250 subscribers: coach has paid ~£49/month × 6 months + £5 × 200 new subs = ~£1,294 total
- If coach charges £10/month per sub: 250 subs = £2,500/month MRR → KLIQ's fee is <1 month of revenue

### 2.2 — PPC Unit Economics

Based on industry benchmarks for fitness/wellness app advertising:

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Cost per click (CPC)** | £0.80 | £0.50 | £0.30 |
| **Landing page conversion** | 5% | 8% | 12% |
| **Cost per signup** | £16.00 | £6.25 | £2.50 |
| **Signup to paid conversion** | 15% | 25% | 35% |
| **Cost per paying subscriber** | £106.67 | £25.00 | £7.14 |
| **Monthly ad spend for 50 new subs** | £5,333 | £1,250 | £357 |

**At moderate estimates:** £25 per paying subscriber. If the coach charges £10/month, the subscriber pays for themselves in 2.5 months. At £20/month, it's 1.25 months.

**Key insight from our data:** Coaches charging £25-35/month (Jenn Lab Fit, Ladies who Crunch, Besties in Jesus) have the best unit economics for PPC because higher ARPU means faster payback.

### 2.3 — Social Media Growth Toolkit

In addition to PPC, provide coaches with tools to grow organically:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Content Calendar** | AI-generated posting schedule based on their niche |
| **Hashtag Research** | Optimised hashtags for their fitness vertical |
| **Cross-Promotion** | Feature coaches in KLIQ's own social channels |
| **Referral Program** | "Invite a friend, both get 1 month free" |
| **Email Templates** | Pre-written email sequences for coach's existing audience |
| **QR Code Generator** | For in-person events, gym walls, business cards |

### 2.4 — The "250 Club" Milestone

When a coach hits 250 subscribers, they unlock Stage 3 services:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! You've joined the 250 Club │

## STAGE 3: MONETISE (250+ Subscribers) — Affiliates, Licensing & Brand Deals

**Currently 21 coaches qualify.** The goal is to grow this to 50+ within 12 months.

### 3.1 — KLIQ Affiliate Marketplace

**The concept:** KLIQ curates a marketplace of affiliate products relevant to fitness/wellness coaches. Coaches add affiliate links to their blogs, modules, and live sessions. They earn commission on every sale.

**How it works:**

```
Brand (e.g., protein powder company)
    ↓
Lists products on KLIQ Affiliate Marketplace
    ↓
Coach selects relevant products for their audience
    ↓
KLIQ auto-inserts affiliate links into coach's:
  - Blog posts (contextual product mentions)
  - Module descriptions ("Equipment I recommend")
  - Community posts
  - Live session descriptions
    ↓
User clicks → buys → Coach earns commission
    ↓
KLIQ takes 10-20% of the affiliate commission as platform fee
```

**Affiliate categories for fitness/wellness:**

| Category | Example Brands | Typical Commission | Est. Revenue Per Coach/Month |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Supplements** | MyProtein, Huel, Bulk | 8-15% | £50-200 |
| **Equipment** | Amazon, Decathlon, Gymshark | 3-10% | £30-100 |
| **Apparel** | Gymshark, Lululemon, Nike | 5-12% | £20-80 |
| **Apps/Software** | MyFitnessPal, Strava, Whoop | £5-15 per signup | £50-150 |
| **Nutrition/Meal Prep** | HelloFresh, Gousto | £10-20 per signup | £40-100 |
| **Wellness** | Headspace, Calm, CBD brands | 10-25% | £30-80 |

**Estimated affiliate income for a coach with 250 subscribers:**
- 250 subscribers × 10% click-through rate = 25 clicks/month per product
- 25 clicks × 5% conversion = 1.25 sales/month per product
- Average order value £40 × 10% commission = £4 per sale
- 5 products featured = £25/month in affiliate income
- **At scale (1,000 subs): £100-400/month in affiliate income**

**KLIQ's revenue:** 10-20% platform fee on all affiliate commissions. If 50 coaches earn avg £100/month in affiliates = £5,000/month total, KLIQ takes £500-1,000/month.

### 3.2 — Content Licensing

**The concept:** Coaches with quality content can license their workout programs, meal plans, and training modules to other platforms, gyms, or corporate wellness programs.

**Three licensing models:**

#### A) Coach-to-Coach Licensing
| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concept** | Top coaches license their programs to newer coaches who need content |
| **Example** | "Shaped By London's 12-Week Shred" available for other coaches to offer in their app |
| **Pricing** | £50-200/month per license OR 20% revenue share |
| **KLIQ's cut** | 15% platform fee |
| **Why it works** | New coaches get proven content; top coaches earn passive income |

#### B) Corporate Wellness Licensing
| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concept** | Companies license coach content for employee wellness programs |
| **Example** | "NHS Employee Wellbeing" already exists — expand this model |
| **Pricing** | £500-5,000/month per corporate client |
| **KLIQ's cut** | 25% platform fee (KLIQ handles the B2B sales) |
| **Why it works** | Corporate wellness is a £4.5B market in the UK |

#### C) Gym & Studio Licensing
| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Concept** | Gyms license on-demand content from KLIQ coaches for their members |
| **Example** | A boutique gym offers "CHAMPIONFIT's HIIT Program" as part of membership |
| **Pricing** | £200-1,000/month per gym |
| **KLIQ's cut** | 20% platform fee |
| **Why it works** | Gyms need digital content; coaches need distribution |

### 3.3 — Brand Deals (Managed by KLIQ)

**The concept:** KLIQ acts as a talent agency, connecting coaches with brands for sponsored content, product collaborations, and ambassador deals.

**Why 250 subscribers is the magic number:**
- Micro-influencers (1K-10K followers) command £100-500 per sponsored post
- But KLIQ coaches have something better: **a paying audience** — 250 people who already spend money on fitness
- A coach with 250 paying subscribers is more valuable to brands than an influencer with 50K followers and zero monetization
- Brands pay for access to **buyers**, not just eyeballs

**Brand deal types:**

| Deal Type | What Coach Does | Coach Earns | KLIQ Earns |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Sponsored Blog Post** | Writes about brand's product in their KLIQ blog | £200-500 per post | 15% agency fee |
| **Product Integration** | Features product in a module or live session | £300-1,000 per integration | 15% agency fee |
| **Ambassador Deal** | Ongoing partnership (3-12 months) | £500-2,000/month | 15% agency fee |
| **Co-Branded Product** | Coach's name on a product (e.g., protein shake) | 5-15% royalty on sales | 10% of royalty |
| **Exclusive Discount Code** | Coach shares brand's discount code with subscribers | £1-5 per use + affiliate % | 10% platform fee |

**KLIQ's Brand Deal Process:**

```
1. KLIQ identifies brands targeting fitness/wellness audiences
2. KLIQ pitches: "We have 21 coaches with 250+ paying subscribers"
3. Brand selects coaches based on niche, audience, engagement
4. KLIQ negotiates deal terms (coach approves)
5. Coach creates content / integrates product
6. KLIQ tracks performance, handles payments
7. KLIQ takes 15% agency fee
```

**Estimated brand deal income for a coach with 250+ subscribers:**
- 1-2 sponsored posts/month: £400-1,000
- 1 product integration/quarter: £300-1,000
- Ambassador deal (if secured): £500-2,000/month
- **Total potential: £700-3,000/month on top of subscription revenue**

---

## STAGE 4: SCALE (1,000+ Subscribers) — Premium Services

**Currently 12 coaches qualify.** These are the platform's stars.

### 4.1 — White-Label Content Marketplace

Top coaches can sell their programs as white-label content:
- Other fitness businesses buy and rebrand the content
- Coach earns royalties (5-15% of sales)
- KLIQ handles distribution, payments, DRM
- **Example:** "Shaped By London's 12-Week Program" sold to 50 gyms at £200/month = £10,000/month, coach gets £1,500/month royalty

### 4.2 — Premium Brand Partnerships

Coaches with 1,000+ subscribers get access to premium brand deals:
- Multi-month ambassador contracts (£2,000-10,000/month)
- Product co-creation (royalty deals)
- Event sponsorships
- TV/media appearances (KLIQ acts as agent)

### 4.3 — Cross-Promotion Network

KLIQ creates a network where top coaches promote each other:
- "If you like CHAMPIONFIT, you might also like REBARRE STRONG"
- Coaches share subscribers through curated recommendations
- KLIQ takes a referral fee for cross-promoted signups

### 4.4 — KLIQ Creator Fund

Invest in high-potential coaches:
- KLIQ funds £1,000-5,000 in PPC for selected coaches
- In exchange, KLIQ takes a higher revenue share (e.g., 25% of GMV for 12 months)
- Accelerates growth for coaches who can't afford PPC upfront
- **Risk:** KLIQ invests upfront, but data shows coaches with 250+ subs have 94% survival rate

# PART 6: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**Why KLIQ can win at this:**

1. **Data moat** — KLIQ knows exactly which coaches are growing, what content works, and which audiences convert. No other platform has this depth of coach performance data.

2. **Built-in storefront** — Coaches already have a live URL. PPC traffic goes straight to a conversion-optimised page, not a generic social profile.

3. **Subscription audience > followers** — A coach with 250 paying subscribers is more valuable to brands than an influencer with 50K followers. KLIQ coaches have proven buyers.

4. **Vertical focus** — Fitness/wellness is the #1 earning category in the creator economy (avg $11,939/month on video platforms). KLIQ owns this niche.

5. **Full stack** — KLIQ can offer PPC → Affiliates → Brand Deals → Licensing all in one platform. Coaches don't need to cobble together 5 different tools.

6. **Aligned incentives** — KLIQ earns more when coaches earn more. Every service is designed to grow the coach's revenue, which grows KLIQ's revenue.
